# **Project 1 : Distributed Sort**

You can use this directory as the basis for your project 1 codebase.

Networked Sort
This project is an extension of the sort program you had implemented in project 0. In this second project, you are going to implement a multi-node sorting program with sockets and Goâ€™s net package. The main objective of this project is for you to get familiarized with basic socket level programming, handling servers and clients, and some popular concurrency control methods that golang provides natively.
